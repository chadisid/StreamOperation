TSAR migration notes
------------
Tsar (Taobao System Activity Reporter) is a monitoring tool, which can be used to gather and summarize system information, e.g. CPU, load, IO, and application information, e.g. nginx, HAProxy, Squid, etc. The results can be stored at local disk or sent to Nagios.
------------

We will make it BUILD compatible with Bazel build system.
